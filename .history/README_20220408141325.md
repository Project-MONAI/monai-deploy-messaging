The MONAI Deploy Messaging library for MONAI Deploy clinical data pipelines system enables users to extend the system to external message broker services by implementing the [IMessageBrokerPublisherService](src/Messaging/API/IMessageBrokerPublisherService.cs) and [IMessageBrokerSubscriberService](src/Messaging/API/IMessageBrokerSubscriberService.cs) APIs. The APIs allow users to plug in any other message broker services, such as [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) and [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/).

Currently supported message broker services:

- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)*

\* Services provided may not be free or requires special license agreements. Please refer to the service providers' website for additional terms and conditions.

If you would like to use a message broker service not listed above, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-messaging/issues) and contribute to the repository.
